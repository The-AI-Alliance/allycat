# AllyCat

**AllyCat** is full stack, open source chatbot that uses GenAI LLMs to answer questions about your website. It is simple by design and will run on your laptop or server. 

## Why?

AllyCat is purposefully simple so it can be used by developers to learn how RAG-based GenAI works. Yet it is powerful enough to use with your website, You may also extend it for your own purposes. 

## How does it work? 
AllyCat uses your choice of LLM and vector database to implement a chatbot written in Python using [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) architecture.
AllyCat also includes web scraping tools that extract data from your website (or any website).
