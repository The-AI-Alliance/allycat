# AllyCat

**AllyCat** is full stack, open source chatbot that uses GenAI LLMs to answer questions about your website. It is simple by design and will run on your laptop or server. 

## Why?

AllyCat is purposefully simple so it can be used by developers to learn how RAG-based GenAI works. Yet it is powerful enough to use with your website, You may also extend it for your own purposes.
